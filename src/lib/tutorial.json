    "heading": "Group contract",
    "description": "A group contract is a written agreement, typically in the form of a document or a single page, created by the group to formalize and establish shared expectations among its members. Therefore, it is important to define a set of rules that applies to all group members. \n\nTo create a set of rules, you begin by writing the name of a category and then clicking the plus symbol. This will allow you to add specific rules under that category. For example, a category in a group contract could be ‘Temporal’. Under this category, a rule might be: ‘All group members will be punctual. Meetings will start five minutes after the agreed start time, and everyone should be present and ready by then’."

After filling the information, you can select the current stage of the task: for example, ‘Waiting’. As the work progresses, you can move the task to reflect its current stage. Once the task reaches the final stage, it can be moved and marked as completed."

It displays tasks on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis, with each task represented by a bar that shows its start date, duration, and end date. This makes it easy to see which tasks run when, how long they take, and where they overlap. Gantt charts help group plans, coordinate, and track progress, ensuring projects stay on schedule and goals are met. \n\nTo create a task, start by giving it a title. If needed, you can also add a short description. After entering this information, select the timeline by choosing a start date and an end date by which the task should be completed."
