    "heading": "Group contract",
    "description": "A group contract is a written agreement, typically in the form of a document or a single page, created by the group to formalize and establish shared expectations among its members. Therefore, it is important to define a set of rules that applies to all group members. \n\nTo create a set of rules, you begin by writing the name of a category and then clicking the plus symbol. This will allow you to add specific rules under that category. For example, a category in a group contract could be ‘Temporal’. Under this category, a rule might be: ‘All group members will be punctual. Meetings will start five minutes after the agreed start time, and everyone should be present and ready by then’."
